### Engagement by Device

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

The new **Engagement by Device** report provides a breakdown of what devices your users are using to engage with your email. This data tracks email engagement across mobile, desktop, tablet, and other device types. Learn more about [the report and the Email Performance Dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/data_and_analytics/analytics/email_performance_dashboard).

### WhatsApp and SMS Liquid properties in Canvas flow

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="General availability" %}

Braze added support for [WhatsApp and SMS Liquid properties in Canvas flow]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_entry_properties_event_properties). Now, when an Action Path step contains a "Sent an SMS Inbound Message" or "Sent a WhatsApp Inbound Message" trigger, the subsequent Canvas steps can include an SMS or WhatsApp Liquid property. This mirrors how event properties work in Canvas Flow. This way you can leverage your messages to save and reference first-party data on user profiles and conversational messaging.
 
### Personalized Paths in recurring Canvases

{% multi_lang_include release_type.md release="Early access" %}

Personalized Paths in Canvases let you personalize any point of a Canvas journey for individual users based on conversion likelihood. Now, Personalized Paths are available for recurring Canvases. Learn more about [Personalized Variants]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components/experiment_step/personalized_paths).
