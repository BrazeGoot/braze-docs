# May 28, 2024 release

### Sanitization article

[Sanitization]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/email/best_practices/sanitization) is a process that occurs when Braze detects a specific type of JavaScript in your email message. Its main purpose is to prevent bad actors from accessing other Braze dashboard users' session data.

### Multi-Language Settings GA

By adjusting [multi-language settings]({{site.baseurl}}/multi_language_support/), you can target users in different languages and locations with different messages all within a single email message. To edit and manage multi-language support, you must have the "Manage Multi-Language Settings" user permission. To add the locale to a message, you'll need permissions for editing campaigns.

### Inclusion count for Content Blocks

After adding a Content Block in an active campaign or Canvas, you can [preview this Content Block]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/templates_and_media/content_blocks/) from the Content Blocks Library by hovering over the Content Block and selecting the <i class="fa fa-eye preview-icon"></i> **Preview** icon.

### Update statuses for campaigns and Canvases

On the Braze dashboard, your Canvases are grouped by their status. Check out the different [Canvas statuses and descriptions]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/get_started/canvas_status) for what they mean.

### Message-level one-click list-unsubscribe GA

The one-click unsubscribe for the list-unsubscribe header ([RFC 8058](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8058)) provides an easy way for recipients to opt-out from emails. You can adjust this header setting to be applied at a message level in your emails. For more information on this setting, refer to [Email unsubscribe header in workspaces]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/email_settings/#email-unsubscribe-header-in-workspaces).

### Visual updates to documentation site

You may have noticed the docs site has a snazzy new look! We've revamped it to reflect the vibrant new Braze brand identity. For a behind-the-scenes look at our new brand, head over to this blog post: [Unveiling Our New Brand: A Conversation with Braze Executive Creative Director Greg Erdelyi](https://www.braze.com/resources/articles/unveiling-our-new-brand-a-conversation-with-braze-executive-creative-director-greg-erdelyi).

### Support for Portuguese and Spanish

Braze is now available in both Portuguese and Spanish. To change the language the Braze dashboard appears in, refer to [Language settings]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/language/).

### Brand guidelines for AI copywriting assistant

You can now create and apply [brand guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/sage_ai/generative_ai/ai_copywriting/brand_guidelines/) to customize the style of copy generated by the AI copywriting assistant to fit your brand's voice. Set up multiple guidelines for different scenarios to ensure your tone always matches the context.
