# Understanding campaign status

> On your Braze dashboard, your campaigns are grouped by their status. Check out the different campaign statuses and descriptions for what they mean.

## Draft

Campaigns marked as drafts are saved but not launched campaigns. To continue editing and begin sending the campaign, select the draft.

## Active

Active campaigns are in the process of sending.

## Stopped

Stopped campaigns have been paused but are still editable. To resume a stopped campaign, select the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> gear icon then **Resume**.

## Archived

Archived campaigns are no longer sent and are cleared from the **All Active** tab on the Braze dashboard. These campaigns are also removed from the detailed statistics graphs on the **Overview** and **Revenue** pages.

To [archive a campaign]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/campaigns/scheduling_and_organizing/archiving_campaigns/#archiving-campaigns), select the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> gear icon for a given campaign then **Archive Selected**.

## Idle

When a campaign is no longer sending messages, Braze will assign an [idle status]({{site.baseurl}}/idle_campaigns_canvases/) to these campaigns to help sort and manage your list of campaigns. With this filter, you can view which campaigns will be automatically stopped and the associated stop date.
