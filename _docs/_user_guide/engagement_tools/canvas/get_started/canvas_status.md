# Understanding Canvas status

> On your Braze dashboard, your Canvases are grouped by their status. Check out the different Canvas statuses and descriptions for what they mean.

## Draft

Canvases marked as drafts are saved but not launched Canvases. To continue editing and begin sending the Canvas, select the draft.

## Active

Active Canvases are in the process of sending.

## Stopped

Stopped Canvases have been paused, but are still editable. To resume a stopped Canvas, select the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> gear icon for a given Canvas then **Resume**.

## Archived

Archived Canvases are no longer sent and are cleared from the **All Active** tab on the Braze dashboard. These Canvases are also removed from the detailed statistics graphs on the **Overview** and **Revenue** pages.

To archive a Canvas, select the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> gear icon for a given Canvas then **Archive Selected**.

## Idle

When a Canvas is no longer sending messages, Braze will assign an idle status to these Canvases to help sort and manage your list of Canvases. With this filter, you can view which Canvases will be automatically stopped and the associated stop date.
