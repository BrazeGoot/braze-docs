## How is my data used and sent to OpenAI?

In order to generate copy using a brand guideline, Braze will send your query including the content of your guideline to OpenAI. All queries sent to OpenAI from Braze are anonymized, meaning that OpenAI will not be able to identify from whom the query was sent unless you include uniquely identifiable information in the input you provide or in your past campaign data when enabling the option labeled "Reference past campaign data". Per [OpenAI’s policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies), data sent to OpenAI’s API via Braze is not used to train or improve their models and will be deleted after 30 days. Between you and Braze, any content generated using GPT is your intellectual property. Braze will not assert any claims of copyright ownership on such content and makes no warranty of any kind with respect to any AI-generated content.
