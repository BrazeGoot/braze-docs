# Multi-language settings

> By adjusting multi-language settings, you can target users in different languages and locations with different messages all within a single email message.

## Prerequisites

In order to edit and manage multi-language support, you must have the "Manage Multi-Language Settings" user permission. To add the locale to a message, you'll need permissions for editing campaigns.

## Add a locale

1. Go to **Settings** > **Multi-Language Support** under **Workspace Settings**.
2. Select **Add locale**.
3. Enter a name for the locale.
4. For the **User attributes**, select the language to be added using the **Language** dropdown.
5. (optional) Select the country to be associated with the language.
6. Select **Add locale**.

## Use locales in messaging

To use locales in your messaging, compose an email campaign or Canvas. Select either the HTML editor or drag-and-drop editor, then follow the steps based on your editor.

{% tabs %}
{% tab HTML editor %}

1. Highlight the text you want translated. Select **Insert Translation Tag**. This will wrap your text with translation tags. <br>![]({% image_buster /assets/img/multi-language_support/html_editor_translation_tag_example.png %})
2. Save the message as a draft.
3. Select **Multi-language** and add your locales for the message using the dropdown.
4. Select **Download template** to download the translation template as a CSV. Then, fill in the translations in the CSV. <br>![]({% image_buster /assets/img/multi-language_support/translation_csv_example.png %})
5. Select **Upload translations** to upload the CSV file with the completed translations.

{% endtab %}
{% tab Drag-and-drop editor %}

1. Add translation tags {% raw %}`{% translation %}` and `{%endtranslation%}`{% endraw %} to wrap all text and image or link URLs to be translated.<br>![]({% image_buster /assets/img/multi-language_support/dnd_editor_translation_example.png %})
2. After adding the tags, save your message as a draft.
3. Select **Multi-language** and add your locales for the message using the dropdown.
4. Select **Download template** to download the translation template as a CSV. Then, fill in the translations in the CSV. <br>![]({% image_buster /assets/img/multi-language_support/translation_csv_example.png %})
5. Select **Upload translations** to upload the CSV file with the completed translations.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

To update the translations, update the CSV and re-upload the file. This means any changes to the IDs or locales in the CSV will not automatically update in your message.

## Preview your locales

In the **Preview & Test** section, select **Multi-language User** to preview the message to check if your message translates as expected.

## Frequently asked questions

### Settings

#### How many locales can I add?
You can add up to 200 locales.

#### Where are the translation files stored in Braze?
Translation files are stored at a campaign level, meaning each message variant will need to have uploaded translations.

#### Does the locale name have to follow a specific pattern or format?
No. You can use your preferred naming convention. The locale name is used when selecting the locale in the editor and will be in the headings of the file you download with translation IDs.

#### Can I use custom attributes to define a locale?
Not currently. Contact your account manager or leave [product feedback]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/portal/) with more details on how you would define locales.

### Composition

#### I want to make a change to the translated copy in one of my locales. How can I do that?
Make the edit in the CSV, then upload the file again to make a change to the translated copy.

#### Can I nest translation tags?
No.

#### Can I add HTML styling in the translation tags?
Yes. However, be sure to check that the HTML styling is not translated with the content.

#### What validations or extra checks does Braze do?
