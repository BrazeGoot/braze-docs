# Back-in-stock notifications

> Using a combination of back-in-stock notifications through Braze catalogs and a Canvas, you can notify customers when an item is back-in-stock. Any time a customer performs a selected custom event, they can be automatically subscribed to be notified when the item is replenished.

{% alert important %}
Back-in-stock notifications for catalogs are currently in early access. Contact your account manager if you're interested in participating in this early access.
{% endalert %}

## How it works

When the selected custom event is performed by a user, it can be used to create a back-in-stock subscription for a combination of that user and catalog item that it occurred for, if the item's inventory field is currently at 0. Once the item is back in stock, users can be notified through a Canvas.

Back-in-stock notifications are determined by notification rules. If the user has not opted in to notifications, they will be filtered out and will not receive messaging.

Users are only subscribed for 90 days. If an item isn't back in stock within 90 days, the user is removed from the subscription. Braze will process up to 10 item updates per minute. This means if you update 11 items in one minute, only the first 10 items will trigger the back-in-stock notification.

## Setting up back-in-stock notifications

Follow these steps to set up back-in-stock notifications in a specific catalog.

1. Go to your catalog and click the **Settings** tab.
2. Select the **Back in stock** toggle.
3. If the global back-in-stock settings have not been configured, you will be prompted to set up the custom events and properties that will be used to trigger back-in-stock notifications:
    <br>
    - **Custom event for subscriptions** is the Braze custom event that will be used to subscribe a user for back-in-stock notifications. When this event occurs, the user that performed the event will be subscribed.
    - **Custom event for unsubscribing** is the Braze custom event that will be used to unsubscribe a user from back-in-stock notifications.
    - **Item ID event property** is the property on the above custom event that will be used to determine the item for a back-in-stock subscription or unsubscription. This property on the custom event should contain an Item ID, that is present in a catalog. The custom event should also contain a `catalog_name` property, to specify which catalog this item is in.
    - **Fallback Catalog** This is the catalog that will be used for the back-in-stock subscription, if there is no `catalog_name` property present on the custom event. 

4. Click **Save** and continue to the catalog's back-in-stock settings page.
5. Set your notification rule. There are two options: **Notify all subscribed users** and **Notify a certain number of users per a certain number of minutes**. <br>Selecting **Notify all subscribed users** notifies all customers who are waiting when the item is back in stock. **Notify a certain number of users per a certain number of minutes** notifies a specified number of customers per your configured notification period. Braze will notify the specified numbers of customers in increments until there are no more customers to notify, or until the item goes out of stock. Your notification rate cannot exceed notifying 10,000 users per minute.
6. Set the **Inventory field in catalog** this is the catalog field that will be used to determine if item is out of stock. It must be a Number type field.
7. Click **Save settings**.

{% alert important %}
Notification rules in these settings do not replace Canvas notification settings, such as Quiet Hours.
{% endalert %}

## Using back-in-stock notifications in Canvas

After setting up the back-in-stock feature in a catalog, follow these steps to use with Canvas.

1. Set up an action-based Canvas.
2. Select **Back in stock** as the trigger.
3. Select the name of the catalog with the back-in-stock notifications.
4. Continue [setting up]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/create_a_canvas/) your Canvas as you would.

Now, your customers can be notified when an item is back in stock.

### Using Liquid
{% raw %}
To template in details about the catalog item that's back in stock, you can use the `canvas_entry_properties` Liquid tag to access the `item_id`. 

Using ``{{canvas_entry_properties.${catalog_update}}}`` will return the ID of the item that came back in stock.
Use this Liquid tag  ``{% catalog_items <name_of_your_catalog> {{canvas_entry_properties.${catalog_update}}}`` at the top of your message, then use ``items[0].<field_name>` to access data about that item throughout the message.
{% endraw %}
