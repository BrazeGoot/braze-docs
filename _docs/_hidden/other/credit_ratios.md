# WhatsApp Credit Ratios (Confidential)

> **WhatsApp** is a channel focused on 2-way messaging and thus anchors on conversations (instead of number of individual messages). A conversation is a 24-hour thread between a business and a user. The number of individual messages within a conversation does not impact credit usage. 

{% alert note %}
In the event that Meta modifies its pricing or packaging for WhatsApp, Braze reserves the right to modify its credit ratios accordingly upon reasonable notice.
{% endalert %}

**Marketing Conversations**: Include promotions or offers, informational updates, or invitations for customers to respond or take action. 

**Utility Conversations**: Facilitate a specific, agreed-upon request or transaction or update to a customer about an ongoing transaction, including post-purchase notifications and recurring billing statements.

**Service Conversations**: A user sends a message to the business. When the business sends a message in response, this begins the 24hr window.

**Authentication Conversations**: Enable businesses to authenticate users with one-time passcodes, potentially at multiple steps in the login process (for example, account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges) 
  - Authentication conversations will only be supported on a case-by-case basis and Braze cannot guarantee specific SLAs. Additionally, Braze does not support pin generation.
