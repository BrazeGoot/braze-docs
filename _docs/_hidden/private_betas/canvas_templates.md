# Creating a Canvas template

> This reference article covers how to create and manage templates for Canvas. Using templates can refine your messaging by creating a consistent framework that can be easily customized to fit your specific goals across your Canvases.

{% alert important %}
Canvas templates are currently in early access. Contact your customer success manager if you're interested in participating in this early access.
{% endalert %}

## Step 1: Navigate to the Canvas template editor

In the Braze dashboard, go to **Templates** > **Canvas Templates**.

{% alert note %}
If you are using the older navigation, you can find this page under **Engagement** > **Templates & Media** > **Canvas Templates**.
{% endalert %}

## Step 2: Create a new template

Select **Create template** to begin setting up your Canvas details. Give your Canvas template a name.

![An example Canvas template named "Annual sale Canvas template" with the description "Use for annual spring promotion".][1]{: style="max-width:80%" }

## Step 3: Customize your template

Next, customize your template by building your Canvas as you normally would. This is where you can decide when users should enter the Canvas, determine which users can enter this Canvas, adjust your send settings, and build your user journey for the template.

## Step 4: Save your template

After you've finished customizing your template, sure to save it by selecting the **Save template** button. On the **Canvas template** page, you can view your Canvas template details by selecting <i class="fas fa-list"></i> **Template details**. 

## Step 5: Use your template

There are two ways to use your template when composing a Canvas:
- **From Messsaging**: Go to **Messaging** > **Canvas**. Select the **Create Canvas** button and **Use a Canvas Template**.
- **From Templates**: Go to **Templates** > **Canvas Templates** and find your desired template. Then, select the <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> menu followed by **Apply template**. This will bring you to a new Canvas with the template applied in the Canvas composer. 

## Managing Canvas templates

Canvas templates can be duplicated and archived, similar to an actual Canvas. To edit a Canvas template, select the template then **<i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i>Edit**.

At a workspace level, you can update user permissions to allow or limit the access to create, edit, view, or archive Canvas templates. These permissions are not yet available for [teams]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/manage_your_braze_users/teams).

You can also save a template from an existing Canvas by expanding the **Save as draft** dropdown in the footer and selecting **Save as template**.
