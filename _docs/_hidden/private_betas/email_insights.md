# Email Insights dashboard

The Email Insights dashboard helps you track and better understand where and when your customers are interacting with your emails. These reports can provide you with rich and granular data on how to optimize your emails to drive greater engagement. To access the dashboard, go to **Analytics** > **Email Performance** > **Email Insights**.

### Engagement by Device

The **Engagement by Device** report provides a breakdown of what devices your users are using to engage with your email. This data tracks email engagement across mobile, desktop, tablet, and other device types. 

The "Other" category includes any user string that cannot be identified as desktop, mobile, or tablet. For example, television, car, video game console, OTT, and similar. This may also include null or empty values.
